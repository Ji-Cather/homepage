Jiarui Ji is currently a First-year Ph.D. student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Prof. Zhewei Wei. Prior to this, she received her B.E. degree in Data Science from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, in June 2023. 

# Research Interests
My research focuses on LLM-based Agent for social simulation. I am currently working on dynamic graph generation, text-attributed graph generation and LLM-based Agent.
