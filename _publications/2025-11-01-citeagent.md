<!-- Traditional social graph generation methods are primarily divided into two categories: rule-based methods and deep learning-based methods. Rule-based methods, such as the Erdős–Rényi model and the Barabási–Albert model, simulate certain macroscopic network properties, such as power-law degree distributions. 
Deep learning-based methods, such as GraphRNN and GraphVAE, leverage self-supervised learning to automatically capture complex patterns in graph structures.

While these methods perform well in modeling small-scale graph structures, they face significant challenges when dealing with large-scale, dynamic, and attributed social networks. Since they heavily rely on training data and often suffer from overfitting when generating graphs at scales beyond the training set, making it difficult to generalize to larger graphs with reasonable macroscopic properties. -->

In this work, we propose **CiteAgent**, an LLM-agent-based platform for simulating citation network dynamics that enables realistic, scalable, and controlled experimentation in academic environments. By modeling citation behaviors with human-like nuance, offering precise control over environmental variables for causal analysis, and supporting reproducible simulations across diverse research contexts, CiteAgent provides a rigorous testbed for hypothesis-driven inquiry into the mechanics of scholarly influence and knowledge diffusion. <a href="https://github.com/Ji-Cather/CiteAgent">Source Code.</a>
