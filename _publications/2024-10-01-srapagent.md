## Introduction

Efficient resource allocation is a critical challenge in various domains, including healthcare, logistics, and disaster management. The **SRAP-Agent** framework harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to simulate complex scenarios and optimize resource allocation policies effectively. By leveraging LLMs, SRAP-Agent enables decision-makers to test and refine their allocation strategies in a virtual environment, improving outcomes in real-world applications.
